So starting the challenge it was obivus when i saw aÂ .wav file that its an audio file so there must be something related to analysing the graph or spectrogram but none the less i started the challenge and got to know that it is a sstv file so i looked about and found alot to be explored.

We need 3 things.

Now we need to install vb-audio virtual cable.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/signals2.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }


And configure it in the vlc player.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/signals3.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

Like shown in the above picture.

Then configure sstv or mmstv.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/signals4.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

And now start the audio from vlc and wait untill it reveals the flag.

![Open Lightbox](../assets/signals5.webp){ .glightbox .center width="500" }

Thank you for reading
