So starting the challenge it was obivus when i saw aÂ .wav file that its an audio file so there must be something related to analysing the graph or spectrogram but none the less i started the challenge and got to know that it is a sstv file so i looked about and found alot to be explored.

We need 3 things.

Now we need to install vb-audio virtual cable.

<div style="text-align: center;">

And configure it in the vlc player.

Like shown in the above picture.

Then configure sstv or mmstv.

And now start the audio from vlc and wait untill it reveals the flag.
