On visiting on the given ip and port this web page opened.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/assets/jscalc3.webp" alt="mannaully

</div>

I opened burp and captured the request.

<div style="text-align: center;">

So it uses some {‚Äúformula‚Äù:‚Äù ‚Äù} and send the value for final sum we can use.

```bash
{"formula":"require('fs').readFileSync('/flag.txt').toString();"}
```

now lets try caputering the request again and send it to repeater.

and we got the flag.
